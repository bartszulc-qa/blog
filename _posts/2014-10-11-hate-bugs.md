Can tester dislike bugs? Interesting question, isn't it? One would say tester's role is to find bugs, so he should like them. This is not the case with me.

I dislike bugs, even further, I cringe when I find bug. 

Not all bugs, not on every stage of development. There are bugs I like finding, especially found during system testing or while testing complex business processes and coming up with various edge cases implementation of tested system doesn't really answer.

But the majority of bugs I hate. Bugs I find in mature applications, released to support & maintenance. Performance issues. Render issues. Broken links. Typos. More. These I can't stand. 

How a tester hate finding bugs? I like thinking about myself as a quality watcher. My role is not as to find bugs as to prevent them from happening. Especially these trivial ones, which can be spotted fairly quick in the development process just by applying standards, best practices and using available tools.

Rewarding tester by the number of bugs he found really doesn't work for me. My goal is to make sure the number is as close to 0 as possible. Please don't reward my failures. Do the opposite. Check the application and see how it performs? Are there any obvious issues? Are you struggle while using it? No? Reward! Not only the tester, but the whole team. Review problems and leave the team to improve otherwise.

Your organisation may have Development and Support & Maintenance as separate departments. Make sure they speak to each other, maintain a feedback loop between Support & Development. Shorten the delivery cycle. Implement users feedback facilities. Everything to get more on the quality of your application you either develop or developed a while back. Use the feedback to reward or improve.

Everything I learnt about Behavior Driven Development I put into presentation which I shared with audience of last year Test Warez conference in Gdansk. Very good conference.

I really enjoy talking to people about my adventures with testing, even if this means admitting to failures.

I do enjoy listening about failures more than I enjoy hearing yet another success story. 

Very often people who accomplished something forget to mention the bumpy road they had to go through. Success without failures may lead to a cargo cult... like BDD.

Here is the presentation.

Google Test Automation Conference edition 2014 starts tomorrow. Though it's in USA, Google will provide live feed on Youtube for you to watch, more details [here](https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2014/stream "GTAC2014 Live Stream"). The conference itself looks really packed. Lot of speakers from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix. Check out the [schedule](https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2014/schedule "GTAC2014 Schedule").

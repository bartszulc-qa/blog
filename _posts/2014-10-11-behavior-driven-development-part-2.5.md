From my last post of the series, you learnt Behavior Driven Development as a process of gathering requirements may not always work. You need all Three Amigos to have a proper conversation on features and their behaviors. Meetings of business and testers may not be beneficial.

What about implementing BDD only amongst development team members?

## Behavior Driven Development Team

BDD is quite popular in development world. Its popularity brings even more attention. No one wants to stay aside. Everyone wants BDD. Having BDD means being trendy. This might be one of the reasons your team may consider doing BDD, even if this means not involving anyone from Business.

### Result

Would BDD limited to development improve your delivery? Not really. You still would operate on assumptions. The only difference between my first encounter with BDD, as a tester creating and automating Acceptance Scenarios with BDD tools and standards, and doing the same as a team, is the total number of people involved.

It's crucial for a team to quickly find common language and avoid having misunderstandings. You may think Behavior Driven Development can help you with that. It gives you Gherkin, which you could as a communication standard, right? But, do you really need to implement a strict standard in order to improve communication inside your team? Developers and testers shouldn't experience such communication gap as business and developers do. At the end you work in the same environment. You're all technical people, understanding technical stuff. Maybe there are better ways to improve, and not limit your conversation to Gherkin Scenarios.

#### Benefits

As with my first approach to BDD, there might be benefits. Not only you will have all the goods you'd gain while working with BDD on your own, like living documentation, but also you'd leverage the situation and use it as an opportunity to bring developers closer to Acceptance Testing. You might not have fully working Behavior Driven Development, but you could have something that resembles Acceptance Test Driven Development, where the whole team works on high level Acceptance Tests and their automation. This definitely could improve execution, and you could end up with more time you spend on activities from other Agile Tester Quadrants, as your developers take from your shoulders responsibility for big tests automation.

#### Risks

Maybe everything will work great for you. Your assumptions will be correct. You and developers will get living documentation, drive work with created scenarios,help you with automation so you have more time to do other tests and critique the product even more. But what if it doesn't happen? Whose fault would it be? You could say no ones, but would you? You spent time learning BDD, learning Gherkin, creating Scenarios, using Tools, and at the end, during demo, you find out the thing you put so much attention into doesn't work, and who says that? Person who is outside of the Team. Who has never tried BDD. You may get yourself into a conflict. Development Team may start fight with Business... or at least consider Business as enemy. Hope this doesn't happen, but there is a risk. The risk is greater then when you alone were involved in BDD. Now there are more of you. You feel stronger. You have power.

You can use the power both ways, close on Business or invite it to BDD. If you consider yourself a good tester, who wants to bridge not divide, be aware of the risk and try everything to bring Business and Development together. You need to balance between two groups so you can connect them both.

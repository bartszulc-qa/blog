Before I start sharing my thoughts on testing, a disclaimer.

I don't represent any company, any company I had worked for, or I'm at given time or the time of writing affiliated with. These are my thoughts, my ideas, so if you think they're incorrect, have a courage and disagree with me in comments or via email. I dare you. I double dare you. Don't blame the companies as they have nothing to do with this blog.

That said, you may disagree with things posted here. You may have issues with solutions, with implementations, even with code formatting. I suggest you lay down your issues in comments section. After all this blog is for me to learn, to validate my ideas, and to do so I need active readers who are willing to stand for what they feel is right.

I'm not a scientist, merely an engineer. I don't have time and resources to do as many experiments as I feel necessary, test my ideas against proper representative group. You are the group. The only thing me and scientists have in common, is being positively doubtful. 

My ideas may work in some context, not another. My solutions may seem good at the time of writing, and lose its importance over time. Finally, they can be completely wrong. I'm ok with that. In fact this is yet another reason of having a blog. Understand all the contexts testers may find themselves in.

I like to thing about myself as Context Driven Tester. I'm not against standards, but only if people who create them are aware their work may work only in a given context and need to be adjusted or stripped down to have application in another.

It's very challenging to become experienced Context Driven Tester. At the end your experience comes from the experience working in many different domains, environments, technologies, in different contexts. Hope this blog will help me become more experienced, broaden my horizons.

BUT NOT WITHOUT YOUR HELP AND YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

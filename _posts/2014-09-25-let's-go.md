Finally decided to start blogging.

What motivates me? I keep forgetting stuff, speed hacking, rapidly developing things, not having enough time to give myself second thoughts, dive into details, read through documentation. Hopefully this blog will help me calm down a little, understand what I exactly been doing during the day, what was so awesome (or not) about it, and post my findings here for you to comment.

Basides my personal goal, I really hope someone will find this blog useful, and not only it will benefit me, but the whole testers community, inluding you... the guy who doesn't know he is a tester yet.

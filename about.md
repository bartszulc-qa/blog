Problems enthusiast. Gathering, grouping, analyzing and fixing them. Not as interested in fixing issues problems cause as finding and tackling their causes. Interested in any improvements, changes to processes, that can help me spot all the existing and future problems easier. To reduce their impact, spot them at early stage when they cause less damage, qualified in automation. On day to day basis, working on Software related problems. From time to time, business, organization, and people related, which tend to be resistable to automation... though, machine learning and stuff. In other words, a tester.
